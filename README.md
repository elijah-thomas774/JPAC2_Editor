# JPAC2_Editor
Tool for editing JPAC2_10 and JPAC2_11 files used in Nintendo Games such as Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword

The [Json Library (github)](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) used is by Niels Lohmann.

Original JPA reverse engineering done by Jasper at [noclip.website](https://github.com/magcius/noclip.website).

The original file used for refernce is [JPA.ts](https://github.com/magcius/noclip.website/blob/master/src/Common/JSYSTEM/JPA.ts). I added in support for JPAC2-11, which is the version Skyward Sword uses.
